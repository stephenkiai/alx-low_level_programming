**Structures and Typedef in C**

**Structures**

    **User defined** data type
    Groups related variables of **different types** into a single unit
    Defined using the **struct keyword**, followed by a **name** and a **list of member variables**
    Instances are created using **struct <name> <instance_name>;**
    Member variables accessed using **dot notation**

**Typedef**

    C keyword to create **aliases** for existing data types, including structures
    Used to create more **concise and readable code**
    Defined using **typedef <existing_type> <new_alias>**
    Alias can be used **instead of existing type**
    Can be used to create aliases for other data types, including pointers and function pointers
