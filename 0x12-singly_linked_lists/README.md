**Singly Linked List**

A singly linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes, where each node 
contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The first node is called the 
head of the list.

Singly linked lists are useful for situations where we need to **insert** or **delete** elements **frequently**
at the **beginning** or **end** of a list. Since each node **only has a pointer to the next node**, inserting or 
deleting elements from the **middle of the list can be less efficient** compared to other data structures 
like arrays.

Some common operations on singly linked lists include:

    **Creating a new list**
    **Inserting a new node at the beginning of the list**
    **Inserting a new node at the end of the list**
    **Inserting a new node at a specific position in the list**
    **Deleting the first node of the list**
    **Deleting the last node of the list**
    **Deleting a node at a specific position in the list**
    **Searching for a node with a given value in the list**

Singly linked lists can be implemented in various programming languages using **pointers and dynamic memory
allocation**. It is important to properly **manage memory allocation and deallocation to prevent memory leaks** 
and other issues.

Overall, singly linked lists are a simple and flexible data structure with various applications in computer
science and programming.
