**Bit Manipulation**

Bit manipulation is the act of manipulating bits, which are the **smallest unit of data** in a computer. Bit manipulation is an important concept in computer science and is used in many different areas, such as **data compression**, **cryptography**, and **computer graphics**.

**Endianness**

Endianness refers to the **order in which bytes are stored in memory**. In a **big endian system**, the **most significant byte** is stored at the lowest memory address, while in a **little endian system**, the **least significant byte** is stored at the lowest memory address.

The get_endianness function in this repository checks the endianness of the system it is run on.

**Setting and Clearing Bits**

Bits can be set or cleared in a number by manipulating individual bits. The set_bit function sets a bit to 1 at a given index, while the clear_bit function sets a bit to 0 at a given index.

**Flipping Bits**

The flip_bits function returns the number of bits that would need to be flipped to change one number into another.
